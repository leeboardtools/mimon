# Mimon
A personal accounting application written in Javascript and [React](https://reactjs.org/), and running natively using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/).

I had been using [jGnash](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jgnash/), which is great, but there are enough annoying things with Java and different versions of Java that I'm trying to escape from Java.


The project was created from my boilerplate [new_electron_react_bootstrap](<https://github.com/leeboardtools/new_electron_react_bootstrap).>
